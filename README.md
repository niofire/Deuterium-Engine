Deuterium
======
Deuterium is a lightweight C++ Game Engine designed to run on the ios and android mobile platforms.Moreover, through OpenGL ES 2.0 and [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten), the Deuterium c++ source code can also be cross-compiled to JavaScript, consequently allowing it to run in any web-gl compliant browser.


Deuterium aims specifically at being...

- ####Lightweight and efficient 

	No heavy computational procedures here! Since the Deuterium aims primarily lightweight platforms, it needs to satisfy the limited resource constraints.


-	####Easy to use / Easy to deploy

	One of the main goals of the Deuterium game engine is to ease the process of releasing your games by	performing most of the deployment heavy-lifting under the hood.
	

-	####Modular and customizable
	
	The main design concern of Deuterium is modularity as well as ease of custom sub-module integration.
	In other words, if you feel something is missing in the engine, you can develop it yourself and integrate it easily
	using the engine's predefined integration standards.
